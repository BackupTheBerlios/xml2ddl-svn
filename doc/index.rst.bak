Introduction
============

Xml2Ddl is a set of python programs to convert an XML representation of a database into a 
set of DDL_ (Data Definition Language) statements.

In addition Xml2Ddl can examine the difference between two XML files and output a sequence of ALTER statements that
will update the database to conform to the new schema.

At the moment the XML schema is designed to drive the database schema, since there is no way to generate the XML from the database, yet.

Simple Example
==============

The following is a simple schema XML definition of a database::

    <schema>
        <table name="students" fullname="List of Students" 
            desc="List of students with their fullnames">
            <columns>
                <column name="id" fullname="Primary Key" inherits="index" key="1"
                    desc="Primary key for the table"/>
                <column name="student_name" fullname="Student Name" class="name" 
                    desc="The full name of the student Can this span multiple lines?"/>
            </columns>
        </table>
    </schema>
    
Here we run the program indicating output for PostgreSQL_::

    python createDml.py --dbms postgres schema1.xml
    
We get the following output::

    DROP TABLE students;
    CREATE TABLE students (
		id integer,
		student_name varchar(80),
		CONSTRAINT pk_students PRIMARY KEY (id));
    COMMENT ON TABLE students IS 'List of students with their fullnames';
    COMMENT ON COLUMN students.id IS 'Primary key for the table';
    COMMENT ON COLUMN students.student_name IS 'The full name of the student';
    
If we run the program again for Firebird_::
    
	python createDdl.py --dbms firebird schema1.xml

we'll get slightly a slightly different output::

	DROP TABLE students;
	CREATE TABLE students (
		id integer,
		student_name varchar(80),
	CONSTRAINT pk_students PRIMARY KEY (id));
	UPDATE RDB$RELATIONS SET RDB$DESCRIPTION = 'List of students with their fullnames'
		WHERE RDB$RELATION_NAME = upper('students');
	UPDATE RDB$RELATION_FIELDS SET RDB$DESCRIPTION = 'Primary key for the table'
		WHERE RDB$RELATION_NAME = upper('students') AND RDB$FIELD_NAME = upper('id');
	UPDATE RDB$RELATION_FIELDS SET RDB$DESCRIPTION = 'The full name of the student'
		WHERE RDB$RELATION_NAME = upper('students') AND RDB$FIELD_NAME = upper('student_name');
    
The example shows a feature of Xml2Ddl, database independance. 
Currently the program supports the Firebird_, PostgreSQL_, and MySQL_ databases, but more will probably become available.

Differencing Example
====================

Another key feature is the ability to examine the changes done to the XML and generate the DDL statements necessary 
to perform the changes to the database. If this is a new XML schema::

	<schema>
		<table name="students" fullname="List of Students" 
			desc="List of students with their fullnames">
			<columns>
				<column name="id" fullname="Primary Key" type="integer" key="1"
					desc="Primary key for the table"/>
				<column name="student_name" fullname="Student Name" type="varchar" size="80"
					desc="The full name of the student"/>
			</columns>
		</table>
	</schema>

Running this program::

	findDdlChanges.py --dbms postgres schema2.xml schema2.xml

Produces the following DDL output::

	ALTER TABLE students ALTER student_name TYPE varchar(100);
	ALTER TABLE students ADD email varchar(100);
	COMMENT ON TABLE students IS 'List of students';

However, an older version of PostgreSQL doesn't support altering the column type::

	python findDdlChanges.py --dbms postgres7 schema1.xml schema2.xml

The a temporary column needs to be created, the data copied over and the old column dropped::

	ALTER TABLE students ADD tmp_student_name varchar(80);
	UPDATE students SET tmp_student_name = student_name;
	ALTER TABLE students DROP student_name;
	ALTER TABLE students RENAME tmp_student_name TO student_name;
	ALTER TABLE students DROP email;
	COMMENT ON TABLE students IS 'List of students with their fullnames';

Using a dictionary
==================

If you find yourself repeating the same attributes in your XML schema over and over you can put these
in a dictionary::

    <dictionary name="column">
        <dict class="key" name="id" fullname="Primary Key" type="integer" null="no" key="1"
            desc="Primary key for the table" />
    </dictionary>

In this example we are telling the parser that the dictionary is for the nodes called ``column`` and when it sees the 
class ``key``, it should put in the the other attributes listed.  
So using this dictionary this would be equivalent:::

    ...
    <columns>
        <column class="key"/>
    </columns>
    ...

as::

    ...
    <columns>
        <column name="id" fullname="Primary Key" type="integer" null="no" key="1"
            desc="Primary key for the table"/>
    </columns>
    ...

In addition you can overide any attributes in the dictionary, for example this::

    ...
    <columns>
        <column class="key" name="student_id"/>
    </columns>
    ...

would then be equivalent to::

    ...
    <columns>
        <column name="student_id" fullname="Primary Key" type="integer" null="no" key="1"
            desc="Primary key for the table"/>
    </columns>
    ...

The dictionaries can also support multiple inheritance through the ``inherits`` attribute.
Here's a rather constrived example::

	<dictionary name="column">
		<dict class="index" type="integer" null="no"/>
		<dict class="pk   key="1"/>
		<dict class="key" inherits="index,pk" name="id" fullname="Primary Key"
			desc="Primary key for the table"/>
	</dictionary>


Outputing HTML Documentation
============================

Some of the attributes in the XML are used solely for documentation purposes.
For example, ``fullname`` has no equivalent in DMBSs. 
Another, it ``deprecated`` which indicates that a column or table should no longer be used, but hasn't been deleted yet.



Advantages
==========

Storing the schema in this form has many advantages:

1.  All the information about a table is stored together in one place. 
    Finding linked tables, sequence tables etc. should be simplified.

2.  Being text it can easily be stored in a VCS Repository, like Subversion_ or CVS_.

3.  Also because it is text you can compare differences between older and newer versions.

4.  Since the description of the schema is abstract, it isn't tied to a specific database.

5.  A data dictionary can easily be generated from the XML.

6.  A schema diagram can be drawn using this information as it's souce 
    `see Dia <http://www.lysator.liu.se/~alla/dia/>`_ and `Dot <http://www.graphviz.org/>`_ 
    (note, we haven't implemented this funcionality yet).

7.  A history of changes made to the table (by whom, when and why) is all contained in the repository.

8.  Migration scripts can be stored in the metadata for certain changes that require the data to be modified.
    For example, if a column is split into two columns the procedure to make this modification can be
    stored into the repository (todo).
   
9.  Destructive changes can automatically backed up. 
    For example, if a column is to be deleted that column along with its primary key(s) can be stored into a file.
    This way if they do undo the changes they can do so without resorting to restoring a backup. (todo)

10. Columns can be flagged as deprecated or obsolete in the XML.

11. Scripts can be generated to automatically check that the data fits the domain.  
    For example, that status is 1, 2, 3, or 4 or that telephone numbers are in the format (999) 9999-99999. (todo)


To do
=====

Here are the major directions I see Xml2Ddl going:

* Support for more databases (DBMS)
* Creating the XML schema from an existing database.
